# Architecture

*Explanation.* What this pack is, what it delegates, and why it is shaped that way.

## What it ships

3,188 SVGs in 20 categories -- see [Categories](categories.md). Counted from the tracked files rather than quoted
from prose:

```bash
git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main -- resources/assets/svg/files | grep -c '\.svg$'
```

Besides the assets it ships a provider, a constants class, an enum for its addressing axis, and a
Blade component extending core's. That is the whole surface. The upstream licence text sits beside the
icons in `resources/assets/svg/licenses/`, which is not export-ignored, so it reaches every install.

## It depends on core, and core does not depend on it

The pack registers its icon directory with core's `IconRegistry` during `bootingPackage()`, after
core's singletons are bound. Registering earlier -- in `registeringPackage()` -- reaches for services
that do not exist yet, and logging there raises `Log [ichava] not defined`.

Core discovers installed packs at runtime. It has no list of them, so a pack is added by installing
it and removed by removing it.

## It requires `ichava/core` only

`composer.json` requires `php` and `ichava/core`, and nothing under `src/` names a class from any
other `Simtabi\Laranail` namespace. The provider extends core's `IconPackServiceProvider` and declares
its constants class and its component class; core writes the `laranail/package-tools` signature, so
the `laranail/*` packages reach this pack only through core. The composer `type` is
`ichava-icon-set`, which is how core's pack discovery finds it. `tests/Unit/CoreOnlyDependencyTest.php`
fails if any of that changes.

## Upstream and its licence

Its upstream is `Remix-Design/RemixIcon` at `v4.8.0`, and the version these SVGs came from is recorded in
`resources/assets/svg/config.json` under `upstream.current_version` rather than written out
here, so the two cannot drift. The licence is recorded beside it, under `license`: its SPDX id
(`Apache-2.0`), the shipped file, that file's SHA-256 and the date it was checked. `LicenceRecordTest`
fails when the shipped text and the recorded hash disagree, and the upstream sync compares the same
hash against the upstream's licence before it writes anything.

This pack is pinned to Remix Icon `v4.8.0`. Its `version_check_url` names that tag rather than the latest release, because every release from v4.9.0 is under a licence that forbids redistributing the icons as a pack. `UpstreamPinTest` fails if the pin or the check URL moves.

Core's [check pack updates](https://github.com/ichava/core/blob/main/docs/recipes/check-pack-updates.md)
recipe reports whether a newer release exists.
